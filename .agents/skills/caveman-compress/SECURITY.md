## Local privacy corrections

The Merlin copy keeps YAML frontmatter and preserved code blocks local during
both the initial compression request and a validation repair. CLI failures use
a generic error rather than printing raw external diagnostics. These are local
changes to the bundled skill; an upstream reinstall may overwrite them.

The remaining prose is still sent to an external provider when this skill is
explicitly invoked. Sensitive filenames are rejected by a heuristic, not a
complete content-classification system. Never use it on private account records,
credentials or documents containing sensitive prose. Public documentation must
use synthetic examples before any compression request. No external request was
made by the privacy regression checks.

## Snyk High Risk Rating

`caveman-compress` receives a Snyk High Risk rating due to static analysis heuristics. This document explains what the skill does and does not do.

### What triggers the rating

1. **subprocess usage**: The skill calls the `claude` CLI via `subprocess.run()` as a fallback when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set. The subprocess call uses a fixed argument list — no shell interpolation occurs. User file content is passed via stdin, not as a shell argument.

2. **File read/write**: The skill reads the file the user explicitly points it at, compresses it, and writes the result back to the same path. A `.original.md` backup is saved to an out-of-tree data dir (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/caveman-compress/backups/<parent-dir-name>/`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\caveman-compress\backups\<parent-dir-name>\` on Windows). Beyond the target file and that backup location, no files are read or written.

### What the skill does NOT do

- Does not execute user file content as code
- Does not make network requests except to Anthropic's API (via SDK or CLI)
- Does not access files outside the path the user provides
- Does not use shell=True or string interpolation in subprocess calls
- Does not collect or transmit any data beyond the file being compressed

### Auth behavior

If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, the skill uses the Anthropic Python SDK directly (no subprocess). If not set, it falls back to the `claude` CLI, which uses the user's existing Claude desktop authentication.

### File size limit

Files larger than 500KB are rejected before any API call is made.
